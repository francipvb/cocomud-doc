h2. Build 25

* Add the command history
  The command history remembers all commands you have entered.  You can use it by pressing CTRL + up or down to go up or down into your list of commands.  Alternatively, you can use command history in lock mode, by pressing Escape, then navigating in the history using the arrow keys.  You can leave lock mode by pressing Escape again.
* One can now paste several lines to send multiple commands (#27).

h2. Build 24

* Update the documentation of the basic features (#36).
* Remove the obsolete settings based on an input and output field (#35).
* When tabbing to tab-complete, the TTS speaks (and displays) the found result.

h2. Build 23

* Add the tab-completion (#34):
  When the client receives messages from the server, it stores all words by frequency.  When you begin typing a letter or more and then press tab, the client will try to finish the word you were typing.  If you're not satisfied with this choice, you can press tab again and the client will display another result.
