h1. What's new in recent builds

This page describes the new features added and changes made to each build.  You can browse through each build using headings.

h2. Build 28

* Add [[CommandStacking|command stacking]], to send multiple commands at once, using the semicolon or another character (#32).

h2. Build 27

* Open multiple worlds in tabs (#42):
  It is now possible to open several worlds in tabs, or even a world several times in tabs.  In the file menu are three new options, to create a new world, open a world in a different tab and close the current tab.  One can navigate between tabs using Ctrl + tab or Ctrl + Shift + tab as usual.
  The feature to change the window's title when unread messages are received (#20) now takes into account the selected tab only.
* New menus to disconnect and reconnect from a world (#43):
  A new menu item in the menu bar, named connection, has been added.  In it are options to disconnect from the current world, and reconnect to it.
* The client doesn't lag if connection to a distant server takes some time (#21).

h2. Build 26

* When outside of the window, if messages are received, the window title changes to let the user know notifications are waiting on the client (#20).

h2. Build 25

* Add the command history
  The command history remembers all commands you have entered.  You can use it by pressing CTRL + up or down to go up or down into your list of commands.  Alternatively, you can use command history in lock mode, by pressing Escape, then navigating in the history using the arrow keys.  You can leave lock mode by pressing Escape again.
* One can now paste several lines to send multiple commands (#27).

h2. Build 24

* Update the documentation of the basic features (#36).
* Remove the obsolete settings based on an input and output field (#35).
* When tabbing to tab-complete, the TTS speaks (and displays) the found result.

h2. Build 23

* Add the tab-completion (#34):
  When the client receives messages from the server, it stores all words by frequency.  When you begin typing a letter or more and then press tab, the client will try to finish the word you were typing.  If you're not satisfied with this choice, you can press tab again and the client will display another result.
