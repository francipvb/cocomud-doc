h1. What's new in recent builds

This page describes the new features added and changes made to each build.  You can browse through each build using headings.

h2. Build 34

* Add the system of channels (#50):
Channels can keep track of a list of events.  They are particularly useful to log communication channels on the MUD.  Through the trigger system, users can feed a channel.  Through a macro or alias, this channel can be displayed in a list, in a separate dialog box.
* In the preferences dialog, *accessibility* tab, users now can set whether the TTS is interrupted or not (#40).
* When changing the TTS options in the preferences, the options are taken into account immediately (#55).
* Fix some bugs in the SharpScript engine.

h2. Build 33

* Multiline aliases/macros/triggers do not bug anymore (#63).
* One can now enter SharpScript in macros (#59).
* Variables are now described in the [[Alias|alias]] documentation.
* The title of the window with several open tabs is now accurately updated (#51).

h2. Build 32

* Add a syntax to write variables in SharpScript:
  The syntax is @$variable@.  Variables have been added to aliases (#45) and triggers (#44).
* Fix a minor bug in command stacking.
* Add mute triggers, which will be useful to support audio prompts.

h2. Build 31

* Improve the debug logging system.
* Restructure the catalogs for translation (#41).

h2. Build 30

* Add a logging system to debug events.

h2. Build 29

* Attempt to fix a bug using the @#play@ function while several worlds are opened (#48).

h2. Build 28

* Add [[CommandStacking|command stacking]], to send multiple commands at once, using the semicolon or another character (#32).

h2. Build 27

* Open multiple worlds in tabs (#42):
  It is now possible to open several worlds in tabs, or even a world several times in tabs.  In the file menu are three new options, to create a new world, open a world in a different tab and close the current tab.  One can navigate between tabs using Ctrl + tab or Ctrl + Shift + tab as usual.
  The feature to change the window's title when unread messages are received (#20) now takes into account the selected tab only.
* New menus to disconnect and reconnect from a world (#43):
  A new menu item in the menu bar, named connection, has been added.  In it are options to disconnect from the current world, and reconnect to it.
* The client doesn't lag if connection to a distant server takes some time (#21).

h2. Build 26

* When outside of the window, if messages are received, the window title changes to let the user know notifications are waiting on the client (#20).

h2. Build 25

* Add the command history
  The command history remembers all commands you have entered.  You can use it by pressing CTRL + up or down to go up or down into your list of commands.  Alternatively, you can use command history in lock mode, by pressing Escape, then navigating in the history using the arrow keys.  You can leave lock mode by pressing Escape again.
* One can now paste several lines to send multiple commands (#27).

h2. Build 24

* Update the documentation of the basic features (#36).
* Remove the obsolete settings based on an input and output field (#35).
* When tabbing to tab-complete, the TTS speaks (and displays) the found result.

h2. Build 23

* Add the tab-completion (#34):
  When the client receives messages from the server, it stores all words by frequency.  When you begin typing a letter or more and then press tab, the client will try to finish the word you were typing.  If you're not satisfied with this choice, you can press tab again and the client will display another result.
